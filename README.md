# CS-5704-Project-4-description

This project uses several classic software engineering design patterns to implement a duck simulation game and GUI in Kotlin. The four design patterns used in this project are:

1. Strategy Pattern
2. Decorator Pattern
3. Factory Pattern
4. Adapter Pattern
5. Observer Pattern
6. Composite Pattern

These patterns are loosely drawn from Head First Design Patterns by Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Robson, Bert Bates, Kathy Sierra. Full functionality for this project is demonstrated here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNZhqJpdRuA
